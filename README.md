Add-on C-Language module to be merged with your existing (C-Language) program / project, giving it access to your Wi-Fi network.

To get the full potential of this module, make sure you carefully follow the instructions given in the User Guide. The « Setup part 1 » covers the steps required while installing / copying the code to your development system, while the « Setup part 2 » covers the steps to be done when you want to add the Pico-WiFi-Module to one of your existing program / project.
